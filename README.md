This is a simple Java program that checks whether a person is eligible to obtain a driving license based on their age.

The program prompts the user to enter their age and determines if they meet the minimum age requirement for obtaining a driving license (18 years or older). It demonstrates basic concepts of Java programming such as user input handling, conditional statements, and program flow.

How It Works
Input Handling:
     The program uses the Scanner class to accept user input for the person's age.
Conditional Logic:
     An if-else statement determines eligibility:
     If the age is 18 or above: Prints "Give the driving licence".
     Otherwise: Prints "Don't give the DL".
Output:
     Displays the eligibility result to the user.

Future Enhancements
   Add input validation to ensure the age entered is a valid positive integer.
   Implement a loop to allow multiple checks without restarting the program.
   Customize messages for special cases like exactly 18 years old.
